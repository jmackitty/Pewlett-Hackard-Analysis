#Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large company with thousands of employees and they are preparing for the massive amount of upcoming retirements with the "baby boomer" generation getting set to retire. They are trying to get proactive with replacing those employees eligible for the retirement package, by finding out the number of job openings that will be open and the department positions that will need to be filled. We used the information from 6 csv files to examine look at the employee birth dates, and current employment status, as wel as names, departments, and employee numbers in order to deterine who was eligible for the retirement package and which jobs will need to be filled. Due to the large amount of potential vacancies that will be left, we also looked into a mentorship program where retirees can work on a part time basis as mentors for new employees, where they can mentor them for their roles, as a way filling the vacancy gap.

## Results

* The largest amount of openings will be for the "Senior Engineer" title, with 25,916 job openinings.
* The "Senior Staff" title will have 24,926 job openings.
* The "Engineer" title will have 9285 openings.
* The "Staff" title will have 7636 openings.
* The "Technique Leader" title will have 3603 openings.
* The "Assistant Engineer" title will have 1090 openings.
* The "Manager" title will have the least amount of positions to fill, with 2 openings.

There will be 70,909 jobs that need to be filled due to retirements if the company is able to get every eligible retiree to participate in the mentorship program.
Pewlett Hackard will need to be start the job recruiting and hiring process immediately to fill the upcoming vacant roles, and they will need to expand their criteria for the mentorship program to include more retirees. They will also need to look at their current employees to see if job rolls can be combined based on departments, and if some employees have experience in other departments. They will need to exhaust all their options in order to fill the amount of job openings that will be available.
